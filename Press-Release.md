## Summary ##

  > The number of breweries in the US has risen over the past few year. That means a lot more great beer. But it also means lots of options and if you're not a beer aficionado, how do you know where to go for the best brews? Beer-By is like having a friend who knows all the best breweries and beers, and can tell you what's up. Now you can just go enjoy your next favorite beer and not wade though all the rest to get there. 

## Problem ##
  > There's lots of breweries and beers, Yelp rates the local breweries overall and BeerAdvocate rates the beers. But now you have two peices to put together on your own. 

## Solution ##
  > This app puts those two pieces together and shows you the top local breweries by average beer rating. 

## Quote from You ##
  > Head straight to the good stuff.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Just go to the site and enter your zip code, you'll see the best breweries nearby.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I was on vacation in Austin and wanted to experience the best their craft beer scene had to offer. I used Beer-By and hit up the top breweries listed. It was like getting the inside scoop from a local beer snob."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
